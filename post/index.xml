      <description>Answer: Multi-threading is a process of executing two or more threads concurrently, utilizing available CPU resources. A single thread is a lightweight sub-process and the smallest unit of processing. Threads are independent, if any exception occurs in one thread, it does not affect other threads.
When we execute a Java program without making any separate thread, then also our program runs on a thread called ‘main thread’.
There are 2 types of threads in an application, user thread and daemon thread.</description>

      <description>Answer: There are 2 ways to create a thread:
  By extending Thread class
  By implementing Runnable interface
  By extending Thread class:
ThreadTest.java:
Output:
Here a Task class extends Thread class and overrides the run() method which contains the business logic, then we make an object of this Task and call the start() method, which starts the thread execution. start() method internally calls run() method.</description>
